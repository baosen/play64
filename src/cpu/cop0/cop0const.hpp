    // The read/write Count register acts as a timer, 
    // incrementing at a constant rate—half the PClock speed—whether or not instructions are being executed. 
    // This register is a free-running type. When the register reaches all ones, it rolls over to zero and continues counting.


    EntryHi,  // TLB: used for reading and writing the high order bits of a TLB entry to the TLB MMU.

    Compare,  // Exception: Set the value to be compared with the Count register. When Compare-register equals to the Count-register, interrupt bit 7 in the Cause register is set. Writing to it clears the timer interrupt.
    // The Compare register is used to generate a timer interrupt.  It maintains a stable constant value that does not change on its own. 
    // When the value of the Compare register equals the value of the Count register (refer to 6.3.3), interrupt bit IP(7) in the Cause register is set. 
    // This causes an interrupt in the DF stage as soon as the interrupt is enabled. Writing a value to the Compare register, as a side effect, clears the timer interrupt.
